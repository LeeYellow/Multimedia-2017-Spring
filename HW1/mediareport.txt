	(1) DCT image compression
		a.) discuss PSNR value here
			-> PSNR = 26.8434 for n = 2, PSNR = 33.2974 for n = 4, PSNR = 304.5931 for n = 8
			-> PSNR means how similar the output image is compared with the original image.
			-> The larger the PSNR is, the more similar compared with the original image is.
			-> The reason why n = 8 has large PSNE is that n = 8 keep more pixel of original picture. However, when n = 2,
			   we will discard some pixel, which result in distortion, and make the PSNR much smaller.
		b.) discuss PSNR value here
			-> PSNR = 26.8434 for n = 2, PSNR = 33.2974 for n = 4, PSNR = 304.9812 for n = 8
			-> PSNR means how similar the output image is compared with the original image.
			-> The larger the PSNR is, the more similar compared with the original image is.
			-> same as problem a.), n = 8 will keep more pixel, and n = 2 keep less, which leads to the result of PSNR.
		c.) compare subproblem a.) with subproblem b.)
			-> Both are the same, when it comes to PSNR versus n(for upper left nXn). The Larger the n is, the Bigger the PSNR is,
			   which means more similar to the original image.
			-> for n = 2, n = 4, the PSNR in a.) and b.) are the same. There's only a little bit different in PSNR between a.) 
			   and b.) for n = 8. Because RGB <-> YIQ just change color but pixel, we won't loss any pixel during transformation.
			   That's why the PSNR in a.) and b.) is so similar.

	(2) Image filter
		a.) compares 3X3 Gaussian with 9X9
			-> picture using 3X3 Gaussian filter has lots of little and clear white dots. Picture using 9X9 filter also has lots of white
			   dots. However, those dots are not that clear as 3X3. In 9X9, both dots and picture itself are more blur. 
		b.) compares media filter and Gaussion filter
			-> the effect of blur is much better in picture using media filter than gaussian one. In media filter, there's no white dot, 
			   and the effect of blur is more smooth and clear than picture using gaussian.
			
	(3) Interpolation
		a.) Compute the PSNR with the origial picture.
			-> PSNR = 26.8497
		b.)	Compute the PSNR with the origial picture.
			-> PSNR = 24.0196
		c.) Compare the result
			-> PSNR is larger than b.)PSNR, which means picture using nearest_neighbor is more similar to original picture
			   than biliner. For this way really picks some pixels of original picture, so it is more similar.
			-> However, biliner makes the picture more smooth. For neaest_neighbor just pick one neightbor, it makes 4 pixels
			   same as 1 pixel of original picture, but different with all the other near pixels. However, bilinear
			   makes up its 1 pixel by mixing 4 neighbor, so output will be more smooth.
